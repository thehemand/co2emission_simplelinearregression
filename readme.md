Predicting CO2 Emissions of Cars Using Simple Linear Regression
This project uses a real-world dataset from IBM Cloud Object Storage on vehicle fuel consumption to predict carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions using the Scikit-learn library and simple linear regression.

Key Steps:

Data Collection and Preprocessing: Loaded and cleaned data on fuel consumption and CO2 emissions, selecting key features such as engine size, cylinders, and fuel consumption.

Data Visualization: Plotted features against CO2 emissions to analyze potential linear relationships.

Model Training: Split the data into training and test sets (80% training, 20% testing). Implemented a simple linear regression model using Scikit-learn to predict CO2 emissions based on engine size.

Model Evaluation: Evaluated the modelâ€™s performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error, Residual Sum of Squares, and R2-score, achieving an R2-score of 0.74.

Prediction: Used the trained model to predict CO2 emissions for new engine sizes.

Technologies Used:
Python
Scikit-learn
Pandas
Matplotlib
